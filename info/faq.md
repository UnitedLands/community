## What is this server?
United Lands is a Towny server, set on a 1:500 scale earth of the map. We have many unique features, such as: war, custom items, special cosmetics, and Dungeons.

## What do I do?
Since Towny is our main focus it's generally recommended to start or settle in a town. Information on how to do this can be found in our Towny Guide. To get started it's recommended to read our Rules page and familiarise yourself with them. Once that's been done you can do `/warp` and select the Resource world to gather materials. When you think you're ready you can venture to Earth using `/warp` again. From there it's entirely up to you!

## How do I earn money?
We have several ways for players to earn money. The main source of income for most people are jobs. You can see what's available with `/jobs browse` then do `/jobs join [Job Name]` when you've found a job you like. Other methods include doing a referral, voting, trading with players, or winning chat games. If you want a more in-depth explanation check our Money Making guide.
