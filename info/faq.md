## What is this server?
United Lands is a Towny server, set on a 1:500 scale earth of the map. We have many unique features, such as: war, custom items, special cosmetics, and Dungeons.

## What do I do?
Since Towny is our main focus it's generally recommended to start or settle in a town. Information on how to do this can be found in our Towny Guide. To get started it's recommended to read our Rules page and familiarise yourself with them. Once that's been done you can do `/warp` and select the Resource world to gather materials. When you think you're ready you can venture to Earth using `/warp` again. From there it's entirely up to you!

## How do I earn money?
We have several ways for players to earn money. The main source of income for most people are jobs. You can see what's available with `/jobs browse` then do `/jobs join [Job Name]` when you've found a job you like. Other methods include doing a referral, voting, trading with players, or winning chat games. If you want a more in-depth explanation check our Money Making guide.

## How do I claim land?
Our primary method of land protection is Towny, so to claim land you'll need to start a town. A full guide is available on the dedicated page, but in brief: First gather 8,000G and then go to the place you want to settle. Run the command `/t new [Town Name]`. Once your town is founded you must deposit any extra money you have with `/t deposit [Amount]` to ensure it doesn't go bankrupt. You can add residents with `/t add [Username]` and claim more land with `/t claim`.

## How do I make alcohol?
A Brewing Guide can be found on the website that takes you step-by-step over each component needed to create a good drink. We only provide 1 recipe (Beer) as an example, but the rest need to be figured out yourself. Part of what makes alcohol valuable on United Lands is it's exclusivity - it's difficult to make a high quality brew. Recipes can be bought from other players or created through experimentation, so look for what works! 

## Why can't I mine below y45 on Earth?
In short, it is to ensure the longevity of the Earth map and prevent a reset for as long as possible. Earth is a custom map with custom ore generation, it is far, far, far more densely packed than that of a vanilla map and as such can cause major problems for a server's economy. To prevent this we have implemented a simple rule. If your town does not own the land, it cannot mine it.
