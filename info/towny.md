##  Towny
Towny is the plugin we use that allows players to make and join towns/nations, and to claim land. Land claims are incredibly important as it provides protection from any potential griefing to your builds, and it also means you are able to mine as deep as you want within that claim. You can view your town stats with `/t`.

If you are unfamiliar with Towny mechanics, joining a pre-existing town may be useful so you can familiarise yourself with how it all works before potentially creating your own with `/t new [Name]` (make sure you are stood where you cant your town to be). Most towns advertise on our Discord in #town-adverts so having a look at these will make joining a new town far easier. To invite players use the command `/t invite [Name]` Each town is able to claim more land with every 3 new residents, or they cost 8,000G to buy one upfront per chunk. If you are going to create a town, please travel a fair amount away from the continental spawns. To claim land use `/t claim` and to buy extra chunks do `/t buy bonus [Amount]`. You can return to your own at any time with `/t spawn`, or visit another public town with `/t spawn [Name]`.

### Upkeep
Towns cost 8,000G to start and the upkeep is dependant on the amount of land it owns. For every chunk of land claimed with `/t claim` 15G is added to your upkeep per day.  You may buy up to 100 bonus plots with `/t buy bonus [Amount]` for 800G each. Upon creating a town the first thing you should do is deposit some money with `/t deposit [Amount]`. You can later withdraw funds with `/t withdraw [Amount]` if needed, you may only deposit or withdraw funds from a Home or Bank plot. Taxes are collected every 24 hours. If a town fails to pay it's upkeep it becomes a ruined state. In this state it cannot function like a normal town but still exists. Any resident can reclaim the town for 8,000G and return it to normal. If a town is not reclaimed after 72 hours it is deleted and able to be raided.

### Outposts
Towns can create outposts, these act like normal town blocks but they can be as far away from the Town centre as you want. These outposts are able to be claimed once you reach a certain population (Your first one is at 2 residents). Claiming an outpost costs 800G and once you claim it you can claim land around it like normal. To go to any claimed outpost do `/t outpost` (If you have more than one outpost please put the number of the outpost at the end of the command).

### Nations
Nations cost 80,00G and the upkeep is 1000G per day per town. Nations are formed by a number of towns binding together. These are expensive and can cost a lot if not managed well enough, so we suggest making sure you and your town are absolutely ready before forming a nation. Nations are a good investment as they give 100 free claim chunks and 1 outpost to every member, as well as the towns in said nation get an icon on the dynmap.

### Prices
All towny costs are listed at `/towny prices`. If you are still unsure of something first check `/towny ?` for a list of all commands or don't hesitate to ask a member of staff.

### Chat
Towny allows the use of several chat channels, on United Lands chat has been broken up into: Global chat (Everyone), Local chat (People within 100 blocks of you), Town chat (People in your town) and Nation chat (People in your nation). You can swap between these channels at will with `/gc`, `/lc`, `/tc` and `/nc` respectively. Remember to follow the rules of each channel.

### Ranks
Within a town you can be granted various ranks that come with specific permissions. Being granted a rank is a high privilige and you should try your best to fill the role adequetely. Below is a list of ranks and the permissions they come with. Ranks can be given to residents with the command `/t rank add [Username] [Rank]`.

- **Co-Mayor**: Can do everything the Mayor can except disband the town.
- **Assistant**: Can manage land, add and kick residents, build anywhere and manage the towns jails.
- **Builder**: Can build anywhere in the town regardless of plot permissions.
- **Banker**: Can deposit and withdraw money as well as seeing the town's finacial history.
- **Guard**: Can manage jail plots as well as assigning and arresting outlaws.
- **Noble** Exempt from taxes.
