## Making Money
In order to contribute to, upkeep, or create a town, players must earn money. Money can also be used to purchase upgrades in the `/perks` menu or buy access to dungeons at `/dungeons`. There are several ways a player can do this: jobs, voting, trading, chatgames and referrals. You can check your current balance with `/bal`. Upon joining for the first time players start with **5,000 Gold**.

### Jobs
The bulk of jobs information is at Spawn, which you can access by reading the holograms and interacting with the named NPCs. Do `/jobs browse` to see what's available, once you see one you like do `/jobs join [Job Name]`. All jobs are balanced to pay roughly the same amount, so pick one you like. Depending on what job you choose, you are able to earn money by brewing, chopping wood, fishing, farming, digging, mining, and fighting mobs or players. The job you choose is not final- if you wish to switch jobs use `/jobs leave [Job]`, then you are able to join a different job. Leaving a job will cost you 15% of your experience towards a levelup, however, max level jobs will not lose experience on leaving. You can check your current job stats with `/jobs stats` and info about it with `/jobs info`. To be able to work more than one job at a time you need to purchase the in-game perk at `/perks`.

### Voting
Voting is a great way to gain money, experience and rare items. Once a day, use `/vote` and vote on each of our 6 sites. You earn a Vote Key from each successful vote, these keys let you access the Vote Crate at Spawn, where you can win rare prizes! Voting is an amazing way to help grow the server too, so make sure to vote every day so we can reach more and more people.
Every 75 votes all online players get a special key, this is known as a "Vote Party". These special VoteParty Keys grant even rarer items, some unobtainable in survival! So make sure to vote frequently to have the best chance of getting one.

### Market Place
United Lands uses a player-led economy, that means there are no Admin shops. Everything you buy and sell also involves another player. To put items up for sale, use `/mp` to access the Market Place. Here you can see items that are currently up for sale and for how much. This is a good way to get an understanding of pricing and what items are in demand. When you are ready to sell just hold the item in your hand and do `/mp sell [Price] [Amount]`. To claim your money go to `/mp my` and click the Golden Apple.

### Chat Games
Chat games appear randomly throughout your play session. Compete against everyone online to be the first to complete the task assigned. These can range from breaking blocks to eating a certain food. The first person to do so will earn some money so be quick!

### Referrals
Do /ref in game when you join and tell us how you found the server. Doing this will give you 1,000G (and 500G to the friend named if you heard from them). This is a great way to earn a quick amount of money and helps us know more about our players.
