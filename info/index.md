## Basics
The first thing you should do when joining the server for the first time is to familiarise yourself with Spawn - here, you can use the vote crate, see who our staff are and have a look at jobs information. We also strongly recommend you use `/rules` to ensure you are familiar with our rules to avoid accidentally breaking them.

### Chest Protection
United Lands uses Towny as it's primary means of land protection, but we also use LWC to claim more specific items such as chests and doors. These offer a extra layer of privacy when protecting yourself within your town. Locked blocks can only be accessed by the lock owner and specified parties. To lock a block simply run the command `/cprivate` and hit the block you'd like to protect.

### Warps & Home
When you are ready to begin playing, we suggest you use `/warp` to travel to the Resource world. The Resource world is a completely vanilla Minecraft world that is used for collecting basic materials for you to get started with the Towny aspect of United Lands. As well as Resource, you can also `/warp` to the Nether and End to grab anything you need from there. These three worlds are completely free to use for all players, and they are all reset at the start of each month. You can set a home with `/sethome` and return there at any point with `/home`.

### The Map
To access the Dynmap, use `/map`. The map shows you where each town is as well as where the players are on Earth. Using `/warp` will take you to each major area on Earth and from there you can travel to your desired destination. The Earth world is significantly different to the Resource world in terms of its terrain, ore distribution, and biomes. As a result of the major differences between Resource and Earth, mining on Earth is restricted once you reach y = 45 due to the massive number of rare ores found underground on Earth. However, if you claim any land, you are fully able to mine as far as you wish. This will be explained in more detail later.

### Towns
Towns are a major aspect of our server: you can either create your own town or join a pre-existing town. Towns are in protected claims of land, meaning you can build and mine as you wish without any fear of griefing and restrictions. More information on towns can be found below.

### Discord
Our Discord holds a lot of valuable info as it's where we post frequently about announcements, changelogs and events. Make sure to join with `/discord` in game.
