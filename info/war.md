## War and Conflict
It is important to know that not everyone will want to engage in conflict or wars. Every town’s default setting is neutral, meaning you can only join in with conflict if you toggle your town’s neutrality by using `/twar n` for towns and `/nwar n` for nations. PVP is also toggleable and is on everywhere apart from towns/bases- use `/pvp` to check your town’s
Please be aware that if your town isn’t neutral, you can get attacked at any time and have war declared on you.

Every towns default setting is neutral, meaning you can only join in with conflict if you toggle your towns neutrality by using `/t toggle neutral` or `/n toggle neutral`. PVP is also toggleable and is on everywhere apart from towns/bases- use `/pvp` to check or `/pvp [on|off]` to change your status.

Please be aware that if your town isn’t neutral, you can get attacked at any time by having war declared on you.
Please do not drag or pressure unwilling towns or nations into your wars, conflict is certainly not for everyone so be respectful of the people around you.

### Minor wars
To settle small conflicts or disputes, players may declare a minor war against another town or nation.
These wars are determined through a PVP battle where the winner is chosen through a winrate percentage and gets a certain amount of the losing town’s bank balance.
These wars are determined through a PVP battle where the winner is chosen through a winrate percentage and gets 25% of the losing towns bank balance.
Each town begins a war with points equalling to their number of residents (e.g. 8 residents in the town = 8 points)
Whenever a resident of one of the battling towns is killed, that town loses a point.
First team to 0 points loses.
Minor wars can be done anytime independently by using `/twar declare [town name]`.
Minor wars can be done anytime independently by using `/btw declare [Type of war] [Town or nation name]`.
To end a war prematurely with a white peace the command `/btw finish [Type of war] [Town or nation name]` can be used.
Use `/btw` list to see all active wars.

### Major wars
Similarly to minor wars, major wars are determined through PVP. However, the stakes are higher as you are not only battling for money, but also things such as land and items.
These wars must be more structured as there is more to lose, so both parties must be consenting and aware of the consequences of going to war. Negotiations for war must be done through creating a #war-declaration ticket on Discord, where the town’s mayor sets out their terms

If these terms are deemed acceptable, the other party will be brought into the ticket to discuss what each side will gain. The defenders will usually get the better deal.
Staff involvement will be minimal, but it is vital to ensure that each side sticks to their word and take action if things get out of hand.

### Sieges
Sieges are a component of major wars where players can cause havoc on their opponent’s town. To avoid mass destruction on Earth, a copy of the players’ towns will be put in a separate world and you will be able to blow things up to your heart’s content!
Sieges are an event possible only during a major wars where players can cause havoc on their opponent’s town. To avoid mass destruction on Earth, a copy of the players’ towns will be put in a separate world and you will be able to blow things up to your heart’s content!
These must also be scheduled with staff to keep things running smoothly.
Sieges are purely cosmetic so don’t worry about defending/fortifying your town as wars are still only determined through PVP.
