## War and Conflict
It is important to know that not everyone will want to engage in conflict or wars. Every town’s default setting is neutral, meaning you can only join in with conflict if you toggle your town’s neutrality by using `/t toggle neutral` for towns and `/n toggle neutral` for nations. PvP is also toggleable outside of war and can be changed by using `/player pvp`. During conflict your PvP will always be enabled.

Please be aware that if your town isn’t neutral, you can get attacked at any time and have war declared on you.
Do not drag or pressure unwilling towns or nations into your wars, conflict is certainly not for everyone so be respectful of the people around you.

### Minor wars
To settle small conflicts or disputes, players may declare a minor war against another town or nation.
These wars are determined through a PVP battle where the winner is chosen through a points system and gets 25% of the losing towns bank balance.
Each town begins a war with points equalling to their number of residents (e.g. 8 residents in the town = 8 points)
Whenever a resident of one of the battling towns is killed, that town loses a point.
First team to 0 points loses.
Minor wars can be done anytime independently by using `/war declare [Town Name]`.
To end a war prematurely with a white peace the command `/war end [Town Name]` can be used. Wars that end with a white peace have no winners, and as such no money is gained or lost.
Use `/war status` list to see all active wars and their progress.

### Major wars
These wars must be more structured as there is more to lose, so both parties must be consenting and aware of the consequences of going to war. Negotiations for war must be done through creating a #war-declaration ticket on Discord, where the town's mayor sets out their terms.
If these terms are deemed acceptable, the other party will be brought into the ticket to discuss what each side will gain. The defenders will usually get the better deal.
Staff involvement will be minimal, but it is vital to ensure that each side sticks to their word and take action if things get out of hand.

### Sieges
Sieges are an event possible only during a major wars where players can cause havoc on their opponent’s town. To avoid mass destruction on Earth, a copy of the players’ towns will be put in a separate world and you will be able to blow things up to your heart’s content!
These must also be scheduled with staff to keep things running smoothly.
Sieges are purely cosmetic so don’t worry about defending/fortifying your town as wars are still only determined through PVP.
