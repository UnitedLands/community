# Introduction
United Lands is open to everyone who plays Minecraft, both Java and Bedrock accounts can join the server. In this tutorial we will explain how to connect to the server using a Bedrock account as it's unfortunately not as straighforward as a regular Java join.
We are aware of some issues that we cannot solve due to the nature of Bedrock so we cannot fix them until Mojang themselves do. These include but are not limited to:
- When warping, the GUI will not close until you've teleported.
- Gradients not working due to Hex values being unsupported. 
- GUI's look really weird as glass panes and player heads look different than they do in Java.
- Invisible item frames are visible as they do not currently exist in Bedrock edition.
- Higher ping.
- Custom items not showing custom textures.
- Unable to click links in chat.
- Weird text wrapping of automated messages.

**You can join using any Bedrock account but not all platforms are supported. We can only provide support for systems that we have tested ourselves.**

## Windows 10 and Mobile
Go to the servers menu and add a new server. Enter `play.unitedlands.org` as the server address and `19132` as the port. 

## Playstation 4, Xbox One and Switch
When connecting with a console Bedrock account you must use the IP `play.unitedlands.org:19132`. The first step depends on what device you own:

**iOS**: Make sure both your phone and console are on the same network. Download `Bedrock Together` and enter the IP and Port and select `Run`. From there United Lands should now appear at the bottom of your Friends tab on the console as a LAN server.

**Android**: Make sure both your phone and console are on the same network. Download `MC Server Connector` and enter the IP and Port. Select `Start Server` and watch through the entire advert. United Lands should now appear at the bottom of your Friends tab on the console as a LAN server.

**PC**: Download and set up `Phantom` on your PC, then join from the Friends tab. Phantom is a command line application so it works through your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS / Linux). Once you have the command line open, navigate to where you keep Phantom, in this example it is in the Downloads folder. Run the command `cd Downloads` to access it. from there you can type `phantom-[your OS] play.unitedlands.org:19132` - if done correctly you'll see a series of pings going between Phantom and the server. From here you can connect to the server using your Friends tab.
