# Introduction
United Lands is open to everyone who plays Minecraft, both Java and Bedrock accounts can join the server. In this tutorial we will explain how to connect to the server using a Bedrock account as it's not as straighforward as a regular Java join.
We are aware of some issues that we cannot solve due to the nature of Bedrock so we cannot fix them until Mojang themselves do. These include but are not limited to:
- When warping, the GUI will not close until you've teleported.
- Gradients not working due to Hex values being unsupported. 
- GUI's looking really weird as glass panes and player heads look different than they do in Java.
- Invisible item frames are visible as they do not currently exist in Bedrock edition.

**You can join using any Bedrock account but not all platforms are supported. We can only provide support for systems that we have tested ourselves.**

## Windows 10 and Mobile
Go to the servers menu and add a new server. Enter `play.unitedlands.org` as the server address and `19132` as the port. 

## Playstation 4, Xbox One and Switch
When connecting with a PS4 Bedrock account you must use the IP `play.unitedlands.org:19132`. The first step depends on what device you own:

**iOS**: Download `Bedrock Together` and enter the IP and Port. From there you can connect to the server using your Friends tab.

**Android**: Download `GeyserMC Android App` and select `LAN Proxy / Join a Bedrock Server`. Enter the IP and Port then join the server from your Friends tab.

**PC**: Download and set up `Phantom` on your PC, then join from the Friends tab. Phantom is a command line application so it works through your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS / Linux). Once you have the command line open, navigate to where you keep Phantom, in this example it is in the Downloads folder. Run the command `cd Downloads` to access it. from there you can type `phantom-[your OS] play.unitedlands.org:19132` - if done correctly you'll see a series of pings going between Phantom and the server. From here you can connect to the server using your Friends tab.
