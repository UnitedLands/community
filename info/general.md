# General Mechanics
Here you can view some info on basic server mechanics that aren't large enough for their own dedicated page.

## Mining Restrictions
Due to the realistic ore distribution in the Earth map and its scale, Earth is very densely packed with ores (including ancient debris!). Distribution being even higher in certain areas. To avoid inflation, draining of ores, and suffocating players, we have introduced a restriction mechanic.

We will be doing this by restricting mining underground while allowing players to do whatever they want above ground.

### Above ground
Here, you are able to build whatever you want! We want to encourage infrastructure such as railroads, canals and landmarks in order to make the Earth map more interesting and realistic.
IMPORTANT: if you have not claimed the land you are building on, your build will be susceptible to griefing, stealing etc. so please be wary of this.

### Below ground
If you are mining in unclaimed land, you will be restricted to only mining above y-45. However, if you claim the land, you can mine as far down as you want!This encourages strategic placement of land claims/outposts and could even result in some dynamic conflict, made easy with our war mechanic.

### Resource, Nether, End
These worlds will reset every month so therefore there will not be restrictions on where you can mine. Our reasoning for the Earth world restrictions is based around the sheer density of ores, but the Resource World, Nether and End will be kept fully vanilla and true to original Minecraft.

## Chest Protection
United Lands uses Towny as it's primary means of land protection, but we also use LWC to claim more specific items such as chests and doors. These offer a extra layer of privacy when protecting yourself within your town. Locked blocks can only be accessed by the lock owner and specified parties. To lock a block simply run the command `/cprivate` and hit the block you'd like to protect. To unlock a block you own do `/cpublic` and punch it. To toggle automatic block-locking on or off do `/cnolock`.

## Greylisting
Greylisting is a mechanic we use to help us identify the group of players who are willing to stick around and help our server grow. Applying to the Greylist is simple: All you need to do is upvote and comment on one or both of our forum posts. The comment must contain your username, age and 1 thing you love about the server. Being accepted onto the Greylist can give you 5,000G per accepted application. Links to the posts can be seen below:

## Custom Recipes

### Sporeblossoms
1 glow berry in the middle, then surrounding it - 4 large dripleaves and 4 pink flowers (allium, pink tulip, lilac and peony) in an alternating pattern. *If one configuration doesn't work, try moving some flowers or dripleaves around until it does*.

### Big Dripleaves
Crafed in the shape as an axe, but replace the sticks with vines and the axehead material with lilypads.

### Small Dripleaves
3 vines up the middle, then 1 lily pad on the top and middle row - they must be on different sides.
