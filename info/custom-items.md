# Trees
To regrow these trees, obtain saplings that drop from their decaying leaves.

## Ancient Oak
A rare oak tree varient that grows enchanted golden apples! These trees do not reproduce and the only way to obtain its seeds are from the vote crate.

## Pine Tree
A spruce tree variant that drops pine cones. These pine cones can be used as projectiles to throw at enemies and deal some damage. 

## Mango Tree
A jungle tree variant that drops mangoes. Mangoes can be eaten to restore hunger and give the Haste I effect.

## Fungal Birch Tree
A birch tree overgrown with mushrooms. Consume the new "bracket mushrooms" that fall from the logs to heal a few hearts and a tiny amount of hunger.

## Flowering Acacia
A new acacia tree variant that grows many flowers. Drops random flowers including the new mimosa flower, which can be used to brew the alcoholic drink mimosas. **(Mimosa drinks are currently not implemented)**

# Food

## Croissants
Craft 5 wheat in the shape of a helmet to make a croissant. Restores as much hunger as eating two pieces of bread.

# Tools

## Landscaping Kit
New tool that allows you to change the biome of the chunk you select. To use the kit, stand in the chunk you'd like to change and `right click`. To open the biome selector  `shift-right-click`. Currently available biomes are: Forest, Jungle, Savannah, Snowy Taiga, Swamp, Deserts, and Plains. More can be added upon player request. You can only change the biome in your own town's claim if you have the required permissions (Mayor, co-mayor, assistant, builder town rank). Craft a landscaping kit by placing 5 iron blocks in an upside down helmet shape at the bottom, putting a nether star in the middle and a diamond pickaxe, shovel and axe from left to right respectively on the top row.
