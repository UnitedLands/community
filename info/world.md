## World Mechanics
Due to the realistic ore distribution in the Earth map and its 1:500 scale, Earth is very densely packed with ores (including ancient debris!) with the distribution being even higher in certain areas. To avoid inflation, draining of ores, and suffocating players, we have introduced a restriction mechanic.

We will be doing this by restricting mining underground while allowing players to do whatever they want above ground.

### Above ground
Here, you are able to build whatever you want! We want to encourage infrastructure such as railroads, canals and landmarks in order to make the Earth map more interesting and realistic.
IMPORTANT: if you have not claimed the land you are building on, your build will be susceptible to griefing, stealing etc. so please be wary of this.

### Below ground
If you are mining in unclaimed land, you will be restricted to only mining (and building) above y-45. We do not want the Earth map to be completely drained of resources straight away.
However, if you claim the land, you can mine as far down as you want!
This encourages strategic placement of land claims/outposts and could even result in conflict, made easy with our war mechanic.

### Resource, Nether, End
These worlds will reset every month so therefore there will not be restrictions on where you can mine. Our reasoning for the Earth world restrictions is based around the sheer density of ores, but the Resource World, Nether and End will be kept fully vanilla and true to original Minecraft.
