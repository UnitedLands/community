## Sporeblossoms
1 glow berry in the middle, then surrounding it - 4 large dripleaves and 4 pink flowers (allium, pink tulip, lilac and peony) in an alternating pattern. *If one configuration doesn't work, try moving some flowers or dripleaves around until it does*.

## Big Dripleaves
Crafed in the shape as an axe, but replace the sticks with vines and the axehead material with lilypads.

## Small Dripleaves
3 vines up the middle, then 1 lily pad on the top and middle row - they must be on different sides.
