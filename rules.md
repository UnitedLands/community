## Rules

##### 1. Use common sense.
The golden rule. Just because a rule isn't listed or vague doesn't mean it's non-enforceable. Staff will always have the final say and sometimes breaches are severe and need to skip a couple steps. If you are unsure if you are breaking a rule or doing something not allowed please don't hesitate to ask. For the most part those who are honest or make mistakes are let of extremely lightly. Ignorance is not an excuse.

##### 2. No disrespectful language.
Including but not limited to: Racism, hate based of sexual orientation, hate based on political orientation, sexism or use of slurs.
- 1st offence : Warning.
- 2nd offence : Temporary mute. (Duration may vary)
- 3rd offence : Permanent mute.
- 4th offence : Some rare cases may incur a ban.

##### 3. No NSFW in public chats

Reminder: This is a Minecraft server, minors can and will play here. Innapropriate talk in general or any public channel is unacceptable even if you are a minor yourself. You may do what you please in private but if someone is made uncomfortable or makes a report it will be treated as a general offence.
- 1st offence : Warning.
- 2nd offence : Temporary mute. (Duration may vary)
- 3rd offence : Permanent mute.

##### 4. No hacking or cheating.

Any hacked clients, mods, shaders or resource packs that give an unfair advantage are strictly forbidden. Generally allowed mods include minimaps, waypoints, NotEnoughItems or base Optifine. If you are unsure of the legality of a mod please ask before enabling it. An unfair advantage may include being able to see your opponents health, resourcepacks/shaders that grant fullbright or similar levels of vision in dark areas or mining enhancements such as being told when you're near a certain ore.
- 1st offence : Temporary ban. (Duration may vary)
- 2nd offence : Permanent ban.

##### 5. No griefing or stealing in protected land.

Be aware any buildings made in unclaimed land or Earth or the resource worlds (Resource, Nether, End) are able to be raided. Make sure to claim your land and lock your valueable blocks. Getting around these protections and griefing claimed land is a serious offence and will be treated as such. 
Intentional destruction or griefing around the borders of town is also not allowed. Border griefing will be treated the same as regular griefing.
Claiming around a town in a way as to limit their expansion is prohibited. This includes completely encircling a town or creating a "wall" of claims for the express purpose of denying land. Towns may still border eachother if it makes sense to do so. 
- 1st offence : Temporary ban. (Duration may vary)
- 2nd offence : Permanent ban.

##### 6. No real-life political arguments in public chats.

This is a geopolitical based server so politics is unavoidable in some cases. You are allowed to discuss real-life events or similar in a calm respecful manner, flame wars are not tolerated. Keep in mind not everyone enjoys these conversations and may make some uncomfortable. If you are told to stop by anyone you are free to take the discussion to a private area. Arguments are unprodutive and contribute to a negative server enviroment. Respect everyone's opinion within reason.
- 1st offence : Warning.
- 2nd offence : Temporary mute. (Duration may vary)
- 3rd offence : Permanent mute.

---

##### 7. No advertising.

We run a no advertisement policy. Any unsolicited public ads are met with harsh punishment. You are allowed to share server IP's or similar in private out-of-server with consenting individuals. Taking advantage of this system will be treated as a public offense.
- 1st offence : Permanent mute.

---

##### 8. No bullying or making fun of players.

Good hearted and minor joshin' is allowed, but once a player expresses concern you must stop and apologise immediately. This is a place to relax and have fun, bullying contributes to a negative server experience. Remember the person on the other side.
- 1st offence : Warning.
- 2nd offence : Temporary mute. (Duration may vary)
- 3rd offence : Permanent mute.
- 4th offence : Temporary ban. (Duration may vary)
- 5th offence : Permanent ban.

##### 9. No alts or botting.

Strictly no alternate accounts are allowed. If you have multiple people on the same IP who wish to join the server open a ticket on the Discord to notify staff and we will allow them access. Any unregistered alt accounts will be banned. The first player to join from a certain IP will be considered the host player and will be punished with the following:
- 1st offence : Warning.
- 2nd offence : Permanent IP ban.

---

##### 10. No idolising or excessive referencing to extremist ideologies.

Due to the nature of the server players may be inclined to emulate specific nations or ideologies that existed in history. This is no place to idolise such things. Players may parody or lightly reference certain reigemes in a considerate and respecful manner. For example: Soviet style governing is allowed - gulags are not. This is true for any other extremist ideology. This is our most fluid rule and up for change very often as we develop the server. It is a sensitive subject and very difficult to define accurately the border between what is acceptable and what is not. As long as you keep your conduct respectful and understanding we will be lenient in guiding you to an appropriate behaviour. As stated previously this rule and it's guidelines are constantly changing, you will not be retroactively punished for amendments to this rule as long as you keep up to date. As a player make sure to communicate to us what you deem to be acceptable and what is not so we can further craft this space into one that is fun and acceptable for all.
- 1st offence : Warning.
- 2nd offence : Highly situational and up to staff discretion. 

---

##### 11. English only in general chat.
Foreign languages are extremely hard to moderate so to ensure effective enforcement of our rules we must cannot allow other languages in General. Just like the other rules you may speak whatever language you wish in private chats or direct messages.
- 1st offence : Warning
- 2nd offence : Temporary mute (Duration may vary)
- 3rd offence : Permanent mute
  
If you take issue with the punishment that was given don't hesitate to open a ticket on the Discord. We are people too and make mistakes.

---

##### 12. Do not excessively ping other players or staff.
Pinging other players unwantedly is very annoying, for the enjoyment of all here on United Lands please only ping others when it is relevant. Please also respect the wishes of others to not be mentioned.
- 1st offence : Warning
- 2nd offence : Temporary mute (Duration may vary)
- 3rd offence : Loss of pinging privileges.

---

##### 13. Do not exploit Earth mining.
We have implemented rules and systems which increase the longevity of the Earth map, this is to ensure that we do not have to reset it at any point and to keep it fun to play on. A major aspect of this is keeping mining enjoyable and viable on Earth. In this context exploiting Earth mining means claiming land, mining in it and unclaiming land to move to a different location. Please only mine in land you intend to keep, "colonies" are allowed and encourage as long as they remain a part of the town. Of course, unclaiming land is natural and necessary. It is up to staff to monitor activities such as these as it is obvious when land is being mined out and unclaimed. This is a serious offence as it impacts the enjoyability of the server by a lot.
- 1st offence : Balance wipe (Town account and any residents to be caught mining) and rollback of the area.
- 2nd offence : Temporary ban, balance wipe and rollback of the area. (Duration may vary)
- 3rd offence : Permanent ban, balance wipe and rollback of the area.

##### 14. No scamming.
Scamming players is not allowed, this means you must stay true to your word when making agreements. Purposely being dishonest or intentionally leaving out details. Selling renamed items in an attempt to make them look like real valueable items is also forbidden. Obvious joke items, however, are permitted. Examples of an acceptable renamed items are bottles of water sold for 3 gold marked as "Holy Water". An unacceptable item is a tripwire hook marked as a "Vote Key" being sold for 5k.
- 1st offence : Balance wipe and a temporary ban (Duration may vary)
- 2nd offence : Balance wipe and a permanent ban.
